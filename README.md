# Cranbrook Kingswood RobotC Tools

These are some general utilities that can be used in RobotC programs.  For now, they are written with Vex in mind (IQ & Cortex), but eventually they will support any platform which is available in RobotC.

## Getting it set up on your RobotC installation
#### RobotC 4.x
- Clone this repository into a directory within your user home directory.  On my machine, I keep the repository in `C:\Users\rstudent\code\robotc-tools`
- Open the detailed RobotC Preferences by stroking `Ctrl-Alt-Shift-D`
- Go to the *Compiler* tab and then to its *Include Directories* subtab
- Click *Browse* to the right of an empty field under *Directory for User Include Files (Common)*
- Navigate to the directory in which you cloned this repository (e.g. `C:\Users\rstudent\code\robotc-tools`)
- Click OK

(v3.x should be similar; I'll add any differences later)
